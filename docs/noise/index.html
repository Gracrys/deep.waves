Until he explodes, the image of the single is really amazing, a doodle of a wolf barking at.. anything, or whatever that appears in the picture, which does a good job explaining the song at first. the song becomes harder, faster, and he loses it, he screams to the listener i'm lost\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe album does a great job in production, harmony and message, its style is something complex, not boring or repetitive, and even experimental, and the band is kind of obscure outside France, one of my favorites gems.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\t"}],actualTag:[{name:a,slug:"noise"}]}}}("#noise","#experimental","#electronic","#metal","#electronics","#japanese","#pop","#obscure"))]};if('serviceWorker' in navigator)navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js');(function(){try{eval("async function x(){}");var main="/client/client.e0c19ded.js"}catch(e){main="/client/legacy/client.57517a29.js"};var s=document.createElement("script");try{new Function("if(0)import('')")();s.src=main;s.type="module";s.crossOrigin="use-credentials";}catch(e){s.src="/client/shimport@1.0.1.js";s.setAttribute("data-main",main);}document.head.appendChild(s);}());</script>
