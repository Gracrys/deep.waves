		summary: 'A psychodelical trip into an emotional and surrealist world of colours and flavors from three known artists, a new arrival of bubblegum pop and neo-psychodelia.',
		html: `
			<p>The most expected album of the year, atleast for me, <b> LSD </b> came in April,12 and broke out all the expectations with a fresh syle and innovative.</p>
			<p> Got a nice audience since its single <b> Genius </b>, a neo psychodelic style with the soft melodies of <b> Sia </b> and <b> Labyrinth </b> along with a great harmony from <b> Diplo </b> and some catchy-pop lyrics, that, until now i cant stop singing them in the shower.
			<p> With the arrival of <b> Thunderclouds </b> they had paved a road, i expected a conceptual album, and the video came to me for surprise, a surrealist interpretation of the principal characters of the album, and, at the same time, a new path to follow by each one of the pilars of this story </p>
			<p> This album, when i first listened to it, it was unexpected, i got myself inmersed into a experimental melody of neo-psychodelia with a presentation like that of <i> some kind of magic </i> or <i> Welcome to the world of plastic beach </i> both from gorillaz, the presentation of a new world, showing o you a new musical product unique and amazing you with some guitar riffs just arriving the first song <b> Welcome to the wonderful world of </b>. The voices created an ambient and great melody, with lyrics talking about world and trips with a twist, some songs depicting that feelings are <b> Thunderclouds </b>, <b> Its Time </b> and <b> Genius </b>,
			this masterpiece consists in a return of what was the bubblegum pop of the 80s with some subtle voices from <b> Sia </b> electronic melodies from <b> Diplo </b> and at the same time modern rythmn with some effects like glitch and danceable sounds.
			A sweet rythmn floats all over the album and waves between sweet tones and happy ones, each songs leaves you wanting for more and you can feel it, not only as a pop danceable song, but even more, in the emotional spectrum </p>
			<p> This album could make a difference, bringing back that psychodelic style, like that of tame imapala or with that acid style of grimes, and even, influentiate many bands from the pop genre... </p>

			<h4>Ghosts V - Together</h4>
			<h4>Ghosts VI - Locusts</h4>
			<p>The first time i listened to the first fourth parts of that album, i wasnt accustomed to ambient, even, hearing this kind of atmospheric songs, even albums, fell in love with the raw style of Nine inch nails, but this, enlightened me, was a contrast between a soft trip into darkness, and also a feeling of bliss, a soft haze.</p>
<p> I listened to this one with a more mature ear, and reminded me of that old bliss, but, even, felt more... harsh... atleast by the side of <b> locusts</b>, like a dreaded end to a big symphony, some noise in the background, <b> together </b>, was softer, sounded more like the old ghosts, enveloping me in a warm feel, feeling myself and the songs, like one, together, every movement felt low paced, but wonderful.</p>		<p> Not my favorite album of <b>NIN</b>, not a big fan of ambient, and dark ambient makes me kind of anxious, i have less of that feeling with ghosts than with other pieces of the same genre to be honest, and, after their new path into soundtracks, they are doing a great work, i feel glad listening to them again, even, in their darkest-ambiental hours....`

		title: 'Noir Desir - Des Visages Des figures',

		tags:  ["#review", "#obscure"],
		summary: 'The noise rock - garage album that made me want to learn french, The inner experience inside the emotions of a common man',
		html: `<p>I could describe the album as the garage interpretation of the daily life of a sensible man, understanding more and more about his feelings, but that would be too ambiguous and short.
And doesnt make enough justice for the album</p>

<p>This is a journey, an album that varies and plays with noise, instruments, and voices, bertrand cantat does a great job, choosing diferent tones for his voices in different songs, Des visages des figures and L'Appartment shows a softer voice, intropective, emotional. Le grand incendie shows a heavier tone, and L'Enfant Roi, opens the album, using a thin falsetto in a repetitive kind of trippy instrumental, about just, a piece of a normal life.</p>

		<p>All the album is full of different metaphores to life, playing with many images and at the same time depicting just, ordinary moments.</p>

<p>Le grand incendie shows a strident harmonica playing in company of stepped hard  drums, many references to riots, or atleast, just, liberation, until the words "cour" appear into place, meaning a rift of water, yelling at the microphone, just increasing the noise in the song, until the last explosion of instruments bursting the harmony.</p>

<p>Lost, which made me fall in love completely, is at first, just a note, an inner observation of loneliness... which ends in desesperation, he plays in a complete amazing way with emotions, his voice becomes raspy or hoarse while the song pases, while in the song, he starts talking more about psychological consequences... Until he explodes, the image of the single is really amazing, a doodle of a wolf barking at.. anything, or whatever that appears in the picture, which does a good job explaining the song at first. the song becomes harder, faster, and he loses it, he screams to the listener i'm lost</p>

<p>The album does a great job in production, harmony and message, its style is something complex, not boring or repetitive, and even experimental, and the band is kind of obscure outside France, one of my favorites gems.</p>	`

			<p><a href='https://github.com/zeit/next.js'>Next.js</a> is a React framework from <a href='https://zeit.co'>Zeit</a>, and is the inspiration for Sapper. There are a few notable differences, however:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>It's powered by <a href='https://svelte.dev'>Svelte</a> instead of React, so it's faster and your apps are smaller</li>
				<li>Instead of route masking, we encode route parameters in filenames. For example, the page you're looking at right now is <code>src/routes/blog/[slug].svelte</code></li>
				<li>As well as pages (Svelte components, which render on server or client), you can create <em>server routes</em> in your <code>routes</code> directory. These are just <code>.js</code> files that export functions corresponding to HTTP methods, and receive Express <code>request</code> and <code>response</code> objects as arguments. This makes it very easy to, for example, add a JSON API such as the one <a href='blog/how-is-sapper-different-from-next.json'>powering this very page</a></li>
				<li>Links are just <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements, rather than framework-specific <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> components. That means, for example, that <a href='blog/how-can-i-get-involved'>this link right here</a>, despite being inside a blob of HTML, works with the router as you'd expect.</li>
